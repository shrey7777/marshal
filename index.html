    <p>I watch many cartoons but my favorite is always PAW PATROL.Its based on 6 pups and their friend Ryder saving the town.Out of 6 pups my all time favorite is MARSHALL.</p>
    <p>Marshall is one of the main protagonists in PAW Patrol. He is the 3rd member of the PAW Patrol and is the team's fire pup, as well as the medic pup . His primary purpose is to check for fires and extinguish them, and to use his ladder to rescue animals from high places. His secondary purpose, as a medic, is to use his X-Ray screen to check people for any broken bones or injuries, and to attend to them if needed .</p>
    <p>Marshall is a Dalmatian pup who is silly and clumsy.He helps Ryder countless times during mission.Despite his clumsiness, Marshall is a loyal, competent and brave member of the PAW Patrol and has helped Ryder and the other pups in several missions. Marshall is also very friendly and sweet, especially to birds. He and Chase are best friend.</p>
    <p>His favorite catchphrases are "Ready for a ruff ruff rescue!" & "I'm fired up!".</p>
